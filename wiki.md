I chose the **UW Libraries** for my repository topic. The Libraries span 16 locations across all three campuses and an island, and contain more than 10 *million* items in total! 


## Seattle Campus
There are several different organizational units within the Libraries, including:

* **Suzzallo and Allen Library** 
[The Reading Room](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lib.washington.edu%2Fsuzzallo%2Fstudy%2Fstudy-spaces%2Freading-room&psig=AOvVaw3FfBY0eNTi7cPgTucfsS2n&ust=1633838834197000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAkQjRxqFwoTCJiNhY-6vPMCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD)     
Self-explanatory! This is the flagship library of the UW Seattle campus (and an iconic part of the University as a whole). Its collection contains more than 2.5 million items!

* **Odegaard Undergraduate  Library (OUGL)**

One of the most heavily visited libraries on campus, typically serving thousands of students each day!

* **Health Sciences Library (HSL)**

 Located in the Magnusen Health Sciences Center, HSL serves all of the UW's Health Science Departments.
